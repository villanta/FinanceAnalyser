# FinanceAnalyser
A JavaFX application to import bank transactions, organise and display statistical information.

# Motivation

This application was created to analyse my personal spending and try and see what oppurtunities there are to reduce spending and optimise saving.

# Current Features

Currently the application was designed to work with my personal bank's export format. It currently uses an adapter interface which allows for additional formats to be easily added.

Transactions can be imported or manually added, data can be filtered by multiple methods to allow searching of transactions.

Charts can be made to show weekly, monthly or total expenditure, either average for pie charts or over time for line charts.
